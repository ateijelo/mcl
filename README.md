# reset-lighting

Run `mcl reset-lighting path/to/region-file/r.3.-1.mca`. This will delete the `isLigthOn`, `BlockLight` and `SkyLight` entries from all chunks, reseting the chunk lighting info.

# prune

This is meant to prune chunks based on InhabitedTime as an alternative to the equivalent functionality in mcaselect.

# blocks

Search and print the positions of specific blocks. I used this to compare diamond distribution between 1.20.1 and 23w31a.
